Polynomial is an esoteric programming language, see:
    https://esolangs.org/wiki/Polynomial

This package contains:
    a Polynomial to Python translator
    Raw polynomial commands (aka zeros) to correct Polynomial source code
        (aka polynomial) translator

It's all written in Python because Python has Numpy
You can use it by passing your code/commands to string variables
at the end of modules (somewhere inside the if __name__ == '__main__' clause)
